# DESCRIPTION

Personal Portfolio Website - Internship Project (Week 3)
This Personal Portfolio Website is my third-week internship project, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details in a structured and visually appealing way. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of responsive design to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes. The goal of this project was to create a professional and interactive portfolio that represents my work as a developer and provides an easy way for people to connect with me.

Project Overview
This website consists of a single-page layout that contains the following sections:

1. Header (Navigation Bar)
The top of the page has a navigation bar with links to different sections:
Home â€“ Takes the user to the main landing section.
About â€“ A section dedicated to introducing myself and my skills (future scope).
Projects â€“ A section that showcases my previous work.
Contacts â€“ A form that allows visitors to reach out to me.

2. Main Section
This is the first thing users see when they visit my website. It contains:
A welcome message that introduces me.
A headline with my name and profession.
A brief introduction about my passion for development.

3. Projects Section
This section highlights my past work in a well-structured format.
It contains two projects, each placed inside a separate styled box.
Each project includes a title, a short description, and a clickable link that allows visitors to explore my work.
The layout is clean and minimal, ensuring that the focus remains on the projects.

4. Contact Section
This section has a contact form where visitors can enter their name, email, and a message to get in touch with me.
The form fields are styled properly, and a submit button is included for ease of use.
The size of the contact form is kept balanced to fit perfectly within the page without affecting the design.

Design & Styling
The background color is a combination of dark blue (#021526) and shades of white and gray to give it a modern and professional look.
The font used is â€˜Poppinsâ€™, a clean and readable Google Font.
The boxes for projects and contact are designed with subtle shadows and rounded corners to enhance aesthetics.
The page layout is structured using flexbox, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.

Challenges & Learning
While working on this project, I faced some challenges in layout design, especially in aligning the contact form properly without affecting the existing structure. After multiple iterations, I was able to adjust the dimensions and responsiveness to ensure everything stayed inside the webpage layout.
This project helped me improve my HTML & CSS skills, learn better structuring techniques, and implement a clean, user-friendly interface.

This project was a great learning experience, and I am excited to improve it further! ðŸš€
